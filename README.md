### 🚀 About Me

I am a **Solutions Architect** specializing in **Process Automation and AI Integration**.

My background as a **Production Engineer** isn't just a degree; it's the core of how I work. I don't just build software—I engineer end-to-end systems that drive real-world efficiency, reduce operational costs, and unlock business value.

I specialize in the modern **"low-code + AI"** stack, using tools like **n8n** and **JavaScript (Node.js)** to orchestrate complex API workflows. My passion is integrating **Generative AI (LLMs)** to transform raw, complex data into strategic analysis and automated insights.

- ⚙️ **I build:** High-impact automation pipelines that connect services like WhatsApp, APIs, Google Drive, and Generative AI models.
- 📈 **I deliver:** Measurable business outcomes—turning slow manual processes into instant, intelligent decisions.
- 🌉 **I bridge:** The gap between business operations, data analysis, and technical implementation.

### 🛠️ My Core Tech Stack

My stack is focused on **speed, integration, and intelligence**.

| Category | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Process Automation & Orchestration** | **n8n**, Make, JavaScript (Node.js) |
| **AI & Data Integration** | **Generative AI (LLM Prompt Engineering)**, Flowise, **API REST**, Webhooks, SQL |
| **Business & Process** | Systems Architecture, Business Process Management (BPM), Risk Analysis |
| **Core Technologies** | Git, GitHub, Docker, Agile Methodologies |

### ⭐ Featured Project: AI-Powered Credit & Risk Analysis

I am currently developing a comprehensive case study for an automated credit analysis pipeline. This system:
1.  Receives requests via **WhatsApp**.
2.  Fetches raw data from **major Brazilian credit & risk bureaus** and other public sources.
3.  Uses **JavaScript** to clean and structure massive JSON payloads.
4.  Stores files securely in **Google Drive**.
5.  Feeds the data to a **Large Language Model (LLM)** with an advanced prompt for a full legal/risk analysis.
6.  Delivers a complete, formatted report to an internal approval via **WhatsApp**.
